# MSFS Bake Helper for Blender

Since blender seems to not want to bake when using the MSFS materials, I created this addon to automatically create nodes
based on those materials and export selected maps in 1 easy step. Simply select your objects, highlight the maps you want generated,
input the desired size, along with any other bake settings, and then hit bake! The UI will freeze for a bit while it generates the maps, 
and then the generated maps will be found in the output folder you specified and you can move the textures to where you like and assign materials.

It's still probably a little buggy, so maybe keep a backup save just in case, but hopefully this saves you some time.
